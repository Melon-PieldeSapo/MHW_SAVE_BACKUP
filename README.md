# MHW_SAVE_BACKUP
create backup of your MHW savegame. 

You probably need to enable the execution of powershell script. 
To do that in windows 10 write: "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned" On an Administrator Powershell Terminal.
(if that dosnt work try: "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted")

# HOW TO:
1. Rename sample_config.ps1 file to config.ps1 and edit it with your paths
2. execute the script.
